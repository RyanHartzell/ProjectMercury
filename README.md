# ProjectMercury
The one stop shop for all my game ideas, rulesets, and resources!

Note: Currently the license (CC BY-NC) is restrictive in that it is non-commercial. I may change this once the project reaches maturity, or I may license individual sub-projects more freely, without the restrictive non-commercial use clause, on a case by case basis
